        <h2>DAYONE</h2>
        <p>
          At Dayone, I learned how transformative great design can be and how crucial it is for teams to embrace it as a driving force. Growth‚Äîboth personal and product-driven‚Äîrequires imagination and a willingness to listen. Without engaging with customers, colleagues, and surroundings, progress stalls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also came to understand how leadership and culture influence growth. Design-led teams tend to push boundaries, while business-driven approaches often favor practicality, sometimes at the cost of innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          These experiences shaped my perspective on the intersection of design, leadership, and growth, lessons I carry forward in all my work.

        <h3>Automotive Industry Projects: Insights & Contributions</h3>
        <p>
          Over the course of several German and International market-focused automotive projects, I gained extensive experience in creating user journeys, conducting user research, and performing competitive benchmarking. These projects deepened my understanding of designing localized, user-centric digital solutions within the automotive sector. They also provided valuable lessons in cross-functional collaboration, market-specific challenges, and the complexities of large-scale product development.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Areas of Focus:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Streamlining Vehicle Searches: Addressed user needs for intuitive search options by analyzing behavior, mapping journeys, and prototyping enhanced filtering tools.</li>
          <li>Improving Vehicle Detail Presentation: Designed user-centric solutions to present specifications and details more clearly, including specialized information for electric vehicles.</li>
          <li>Enhancing Dealer Connections: Developed journeys and prototypes to simplify user access to dealer and service information.</li>
          <li>Simplifying Trade-in Processes: Worked on mapping and refining the journey for trading in vehicles, ensuring clarity and usability.</li>
          <li>Boosting Model Discoverability: Created solutions to improve the visibility and comparison of car models, responding to user difficulties highlighted by research.</li>
          <li>AI Workshop for Ecosystem Integration: Participated in a workshop exploring the integration of AI technologies into the automotive ecosystem. The focus was on how AI could enhance user experiences, particularly in vehicle configurations and service optimizations, enabling more personalized and efficient interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This experience equipped me with a strong foundation in user-centric design, strategic problem-solving, and the ability to deliver tailored solutions in complex, multi-stakeholder environments.
        </p>

        <h3>UX Design for ADAS System Configuration Tool</h3>
        <p>
          I contributed to the UX design of a dashboard for an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) configuration tool. The primary goal was to simplify the process for mechanics setting up car systems such as cameras and sensors. Working closely with a development-focused Product Owner, the key challenge was balancing complex technical requirements with an intuitive and user-friendly interface, tailored to non-technical users like mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team focused on creating a dashboard that was efficient, easy to navigate, and practical for real-world use. The final design aimed to streamline configuration tasks, ensuring processes could be completed quickly and accurately. The project was showcased at an industry trade show, reflecting its innovative approach to improving the mechanic's workflow and user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Guest List & Artist Dashboard App (Confidential Project)</h3>
        <p>
          I contributed to the design of the user flow and dashboard for a confidential app aimed at simplifying the guest list process and providing an intuitive artist dashboard. My responsibilities included designing the guest list flow, login processes, artist pages, and mission pages. Working closely with my UX Lead, we quickly developed and presented the first prototype for both guests and artists, based on user insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary goal of the app was to reduce stress for guests and venue staff by simplifying event entry and navigation. In the absence of a clear brand or concept, I led research efforts to understand event workflows and user expectations, ensuring the app addressed the needs of both parties effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to its functional goals, the app had a social impact mission: a portion of its income supports music education for children in need. The app was designed to save time and money, streamline event processes, reduce queues, and enhance the overall experience for both attendees and venue staff.

        <h4>Carhartt WIP</h4>
        <p>
          As a UX Designer within the Digital Design Team at Carhartt, I was tasked with addressing several key challenges, blending both UX and UI design to create holistic solutions that improved user experience across various platforms.
        </p>

        <h3>Inefficient Help Desk Experience</h3>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <div className="section">
          Users struggled with accessing help and support, making it difficult for them to resolve issues efficiently on both the web and app platforms.
        </div>

        <h4>Method</h4>
        <div className="section">
          I conducted benchmark research, identifying key pain points and understanding the needs of our target audience. I mapped out the user journey to highlight friction points and collaborated directly with developers to ensure technical feasibility. We presented my findings and solutions to the dev team, ensuring alignment on user needs and design requirements.
        </div>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <div className="section">
          I developed intuitive user flows and interfaces that made it easier for customers to access support, track their requests, and receive timely updates. The improved design significantly reduced service request resolution time and increased customer satisfaction.
        </div>

        <h3>Checkout Experience Optimization</h3>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <div className="section">
          The checkout process was cumbersome, particularly for users in the U.S. and German markets, which led to higher cart abandonment rates and a frustrating user experience.
        </div>

        <h4>Method</h4>
        <div className="section">
          I worked closely with the Digital Design Lead, and SEO Marketers to understand market-specific needs and user behavior. We all collaborated on addressing friction points in the checkout flow. I ensured the design was aligned with SEO best practices to enhance discoverability and conversion.
        </div>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <div className="section">
          I redesigned the checkout system, optimizing mobile usability, improving the filter system, and simplifying the overall flow. The new design streamlined the purchasing process, resulting in lower cart abandonment rates and higher conversions.
        </div>

        <h3>Transitioning Design Tools from Sketch to Figma</h3>

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <div className="section">
          The team was facing challenges in collaboration due to the limitations of Sketch, and it was crucial to transition to a more flexible design system.
        </div>

        <h4>Method</h4>
        <div className="section">
          I worked closely with the Design Lead to evaluate Figma‚Äôs features and its potential to improve workflow.
        </div>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <div className="section">
          By transitioning the design system to Figma, I improved team collaboration, allowing for real-time feedback, seamless handoffs, and more efficient workflows. This also improved consistency across design outputs and made cross-functional collaboration smoother.

                Looking back, it was an exhilarating, fast-paced journey. Both brands experienced rapid growth over
                those three and something years, and every initiative we launched seemed to succeed. It was an exciting
                time‚Äîfull of creativity, risk, and reward. There were moments of self-doubt and times when I didn‚Äôt feel
                fully valued, but those challenges only made the experience more memorable. Ultimately, it was a truly
                magical period of growth and discovery. If given the chance, I would relive those years in the same way,
                and likely make the same decision to move on when I did.
