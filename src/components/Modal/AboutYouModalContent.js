        <h2> About You</h2>
            <p>
                I played a significant role in the 
                creative evolution of the company’s brand strategy, contributing to key projects like the LeGer by Lena Gercke label and other major brand initiatives. 
                During my time at EDITED, About You was undergoing a strategic shift towards a broader, mainstream audience, which required adapting lessons learned from previous 
                projects with EDITED in more niche markets. 
                This process focused on enhancing personalization and creating a user-centered platform, key to competing with major players in the e-commerce sector.
